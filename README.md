# Markdown to LaTex
## Description
This projects goal is to transform Markdown documents into LaTeX documents and calculate simple functions.  
The focus lies on the conversion and as of now (v1.0) there is only the option to calculate a function with a single variable with given input.

## Usage
How to use the program, as well as all the things one has to bear in mind for the Markdown input can be found [here](https://github.com/fb89zila/exam-repo_swe-sose21/wiki/User#user-section).
