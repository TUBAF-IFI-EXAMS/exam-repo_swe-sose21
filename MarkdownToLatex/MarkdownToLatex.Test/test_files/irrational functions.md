# Irrational functions
## Definition
Irrational functions consist of at least one squared polynomial function.

\[f(x)=\sqrt[n]{P(x)}\]

> If the domain is the set of positive real numbers the solution of the function is either a rational or irrational number.
>> A function is still rational if it contains irrational numbers.
>> 
>> In the case that **P(x)** is below zero the functions solution is a complex number. 

### Examples

The simplest irrational function is:
!{svfunc} f(2)=sqrt(x):x !{result}

But they can also be more complicated, with multiple roots:
!{svfunc} f(2)=(sqrt(x^2+2*x-1))/(sqrt(x^5-1)):x !{result}
