# Rational functions
## Definition
A rational function consists of two polynomial functions, with one being the numerator and the other the denominator of a rational fraction.

\[f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\]

The rational fraction can also be split into multiple summands.

> If the denominator **Q(x)** has one or multiple roots **f(x)** is *not defined* in those.

## Examples

The following function is not defined in $x=\pm 5$ and its **limit diverges**.
!{svfunc} f(5)=(x^3-2*x)/(2*(x-5)):x !{result}

Here the domain of the function is the *set of all real numbers*:
!{svfunc} f(0)=(x^2+2)/(x^2+1):x !{result}
