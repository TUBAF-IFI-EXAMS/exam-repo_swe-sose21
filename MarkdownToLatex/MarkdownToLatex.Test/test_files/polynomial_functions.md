# Polynomial Functions
## Standard Form

A polynomial function of second degree (also referred to as quadratic function) can be written as
!{svfunc} f(x)=a*x^2+b*x+c:x !

## Example

As an example, take the following function, which is a polyomial of fourth degree (quartic function):
!{svfunc} f(x)=6*x^4-9*x^3+12*x^2+2*x-89:x !{result(0)}

As you can see, it intersects with the y-Axis at $x = -89$.

## Number of Roots

A polynomial function can have different amounts of roots depending on the domain of the function:
- If only real numbers are considered, it can have $0$ to $n$ roots
  - $n$ is the degree of the polynomial function
- If complex numbers are considered, it has **always exactly** $n$ roots

This is because of the *Fundamental theorem of algebra*:
> every non-zero, single-variable, degree n polynomial with complex coefficients has, counted with multiplicity, exactly n complex roots.
